wbstats v0.2 (Release date: 12/29/2017)
==============
Bug fixes:
* wbdatacatalog() now returns all catalog entries instead of first 10
* When only Namibia is queried the iso2c column now returns "NA" instead of logical NA
* For some indicators wb() queries would return iso3c IDs in the iso2c column. This is a behavior
  of the world bank API. This is now properly handled.

Changes:
* Now uses Version 2 of the World Bank API.
* More explicit error messaging when encountering API call errors
* v2 of the API returns some new columns the old version didn't. Including
  data of last update for all available data sources

==============

* Add 'aggregates' and 'countries_only' options to wb() per bapfeld pr
* update cached data in wb_cachelist
